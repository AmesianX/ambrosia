Ambrosia is a proof of concept XMPP/Jabber server.  It does not have many
features, and is not intended for use in a production environment.  It
was mainly created as an exercise to show that an XMPP server in C++ is
possible by using Iris, the same library that powers the Psi client.

Features:
  - Client connections, using SASL or iq:auth methods
  - Server to server connectivity
  - Message delivery
  - SSL/TLS and SASL-based encryption for clients

Problems:
  - No roster
  - No presence
  - Can't save vcards
  - Probably tons of bugs and memory leaks
